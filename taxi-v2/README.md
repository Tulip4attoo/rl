# [PYTHON] Q-learning for playing Flappy Bird

## Introduction

Here is my python source code for training an agent using Q-learning to play [Taxi-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/).

Taxi-v2 is an OpenAI gym environment.

## Articles

Here is a [detail article](http://tulip4attoo.github.io/lam-quen-openai-gym-2/) (written in Vietnamese) about Q learning algorithm and how to implement it to solve Taxi-v2, a gym enviroment.

## Guidelines

With my code, you can:

+ Train your model from scratch by running `python core.py`
+ Load and show your trained model by running `python load_and_show.py`


## Requirements

+ python 3
+ gym
+ numpy
