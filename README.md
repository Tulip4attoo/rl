# RL

Reinforcement Learning is a trending topic with huge steps in ML recent years. This Repo is created to:

+ save my Reinforcement Learning projects.
+ save my notes when learning.

# Projects

## [Taxi-v2](https://github.com/Tulip4attoo/rl/tree/master/taxi-v2)

Using Q table to solve Taxi-v0 problem. Use encoded (and small finite set of) state as input.

## [Cartpole](https://github.com/Tulip4attoo/rl/tree/master/cartpole)

Using Deep Q Network (DQN) to solve Cartpole problem. 

Use TensorFlow.

## [Pong-v0](https://github.com/Tulip4attoo/rl/tree/master/pong-v0)

Using Deep Q Network (DQN) to solve Cartpole problem. Use screenshot as input.

Use TensorFlow.

# Notes

All my code are using Python3.

My first version is using TF, but I am switching to Pytorch.
